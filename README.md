 ## The specification for the pennytoken micropayment system

The pennytoken specification aims to define a micropayment system that provides an immediate benefit both to the content providers and the consumers. The goal is friction-free cross-provider consumption of online media and other services. 

By forcing interoperability, it tries to prevent lock-in effects as well as a harmful fragmentation. It also leaves room for competing operators to differentiate.


## The actors 

Three types of actors interplay during a micropayment transacting. 

1. The content creator 
    For example the operator of an online news website. 
2. The user
    For example a person browsing the internet, consuming media content on different websites. 
3. The micropayment service provider 
    He is paid by the user and pays the content creators according to usage. 

## Design goals 

 * No tracking  scripts. 
 * Avoid user tracking by the content providers. 
 * Easy implementation for the content providers.
 * Pay-per-view for prices comparable to advertisement revenue. 
 * Frictionless user experience. No registrations, no subscriptions, no logins.
